# HuaYun-BJUT-MIP-Multilabel-Cloud-Dataset
## A new multilabel ground-based cloud dataset.

The pictures in HBMMCD (HuaYun BJUT multilabel MIP Cloud Dataset) are from the proprietary equipment of [HUAYUN SOUDING company](http://www.hysdqx.com/). The HBMCD dataset contains 25104 cloud images. According to the World Meterological Organization’s genera-based classification recommendation, we divide into 11 different categories： Ac, Sc, Ns, Cu, Ci, Cc, Cb, As, No, Cs, St. The criteria for each cloud classification are shown in another dataset description(table2) [HBMCD](https://github.com/SadaharuZL/HuaYun-BJUT-MIP-Cloud-Dataset). The data set is divided into image and label, where the label is in CSV format, which is shown in Figure 1. It combines the image path with the image category so that the program can be called easily. The corresponding relationship between cloud categories and digital labels is shown in Table 1
Finally, The classification results of the pictures have been recognized by the professional staff of HUAYUN SOUDING company.
